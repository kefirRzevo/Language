# Language

## Introduction

This my own language. The parser uses recursive descent and then it creates a tree. After that this tree is compiling into asmcode. Then this asmcode is runned by my own processor (prepared program is "proc", I made it before).

## How to use
1) Copy For usage
2) Write your program (using keywords in file KEYWORDS) in file example.txt
3) Create asmcode, using ./app and run it by my processor using ./proc 

For usage:

```
git clone https://github.com/kefirRzevo/Language.git
cd Language
make
./app
./proc
```
